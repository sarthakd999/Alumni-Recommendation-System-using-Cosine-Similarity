Alumni Recommendation system will help Final year students and alumni to meet the peers with similar skills.

An alumni recommendation system using cosine similarity is a project that involves building a system to recommend potential job candidates to employers based on the similarity between their profiles and the job requirements. The system uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the profiles of alumni and the job requirements provided by the employer.

The project involves collecting data on alumni profiles, such as their academic background, work experience, skills, and interests, and storing it in a database. The employer provides job requirements, which are also stored in the database. The system then uses cosine similarity to compute a score for each alumni profile based on their similarity to the job requirements.

The cosine similarity algorithm calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors representing the alumni profile and job requirements. A score of 1 indicates a perfect match between the alumni profile and job requirements, while a score of 0 indicates no similarity.

Once the system computes the scores for all alumni profiles, it recommends the top candidates to the employer based on the highest similarity scores.

Overall, the alumni recommendation system using cosine similarity can further be used as a useful tool for employers to quickly identify potential job candidates from a large pool of alumni profiles based on the similarity between their skills and job requirements.
